# LLM_Item_Recommendation
Prompt Engineering of LLM for item recommendation task

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) as recommenders through strategic prompting involves crafting precise and contextually relevant queries to obtain tailored suggestions. In this project, we apply prompt engineering techniques to ask one of the most popular LLM (ChatGPT) to generate movie suggestions based on user's watch history and compare its result with a baseline collaborative filtering recommender system.

# Data
